<h3 class="title">List of things to decide - UI Edition</h3>
<p>Cards elements?</p>
<p>Action colour? Suggested according to artificial intelligence is some sort of turquoise. </p>
<p>Colour for all things standards (links/names) is red</p>
<p>White menu bar - more breathing space</p>
<p>Black mini utils bar?</p>
<p>Gradient bg?</p>

  According to research the most critical things on this page are: the lifecycle and the benefits. According to Silvio we need to boost sales so pump up that price box.
  Elements are organised on the mockup by order of importance.
</p>

<p>What to do with the sustainable goals?</p>
<p>Life cycle opens in a popup? (to test but I would say so)</p>
<p>Licenses?</p>
<p>Prices have conversion in different currencies</p>
<p>Benefits of standards default?</p>
<p>We need to pull the preview into the page with a "see more"</p>
<p>Follow option would be nice</p>

<p class="opacity-50 mb-1 mt-1">
  According to research most people actually caring about this page are novices. The main actions are: finding a std -> search, std per topics -> search, learn about the company -> one of the boxes, buy -> search, certif -> box. <br>
  We want to have a page where the experts have a nice chunky search cause that's all they care about, but also where first timers can understand what's up.
</p>

<p>Search by topics is in dd(dropdown) or visible? - I strongly recommend visible</p>
<p>3 boxes under the search: case studies? iso as a company? certification? Join?</p>
<p>How many news to display and how under the 3 boxes</p>
<p>Are those news featured ones or latest?</p>
<p>Star standards, how many? Which info about them?</p>

<h3 class="title"> <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/6U0Ik85EF1TYqXBOJtufCa/Design-basics?node-id=1387%3A16100">ðŸŽ¨ Topic page </a> </h3>
<p class="opacity-50 mb-1 mt-1">
  Novices are very interested by topics. Currently you find iso by typing "iso 5432" in google. People who type "standard on water preservation" will N O T see iso!!!! Those pages are critical. Some people come without knowledge of iso numbers. Normal people think in terms of subjects, not obscure numbers.
</p>

<p>Which are the topics?</p>
<p>How do they fit in the general architecture</p>
<p>How do we do big umbrella (Sustainability) and its sub elements (water, climate etc)</p>
<p>I consider the current UI (colours excluded) as ok for the most part</p>
<p>Important to consider empty states</p>

<p class="opacity-50 mb-1 mt-1">
  Less is more. More breathing room, a focus on content, less need to have pictures, less visual noise. <br>
  We want people to see which standards it relates to and which other news are about the same subject. People care about subjects/topics, not about news in general.

<p>Only newsletter on the right?</p>

<h3 class="title">List of things to keep in mind</h3>
