<h5 class="question font-bold mb-2">Practical things</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Practice with someone to see where you get sidetracked, what are your weaknesses? Are you rushing? Are you stressed out?</li>
  <li>Practice with the mic so you're not blowing in it or whistling or having poor sound</li>
  <li>Know where you'll record, with which mic, with which app, and test it (twice!) to be extra safe</li>
  <li>Practice channeling your inner overconfident super at ease self. Take it as a fun learning experience ;) </li>
  <li>Remember that even if you miserably fail and completely ruin a podcast, there are worse things and it's great if the worst thing in your life atm is ruining a podcast</li>
</ul>
